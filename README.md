**Connect your apps to ProcessWire CMS!**

This module helps you to create an api, to which an app or an external service can connect to.

**A special thanks goes to [Thomas Aull](https://github.com/thomasaull)** , whose module [RestApi](https://modules.processwire.com/modules/rest-api/) was the starting point to this project.

**Credits:** go to [Benjamin Milde](https://github.com/LostKobrakai) for his code example on how to use FastRoute with ProcessWire and [Camilo Castro](https://gist.github.com/clsource) for this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/clsource/dc7be74afcbfc5fe752c)

## Changelog

### Changes in 1.1.2 (2021-01-18)

- Fixes an error that occurred when something other than an array was to be output as response

### Changes in 1.1.1 (2021-01-13)

- Fixes critical issue "incorrect integer value" that happened in some db-configurations

### Changes in 1.1.0 (2021-01-03)

- Improved AppApi-dashboard
- Allow multiple levels to routing config (by @twinklebob, thanks for PR ðŸ¤—)
- Allow requests without an api-key: You can now mark an application as "default application". If you did so, every request without an apikey will be linked with that application.
- You can now set a custom response-code in case of success. Simply include your response-code number on key "responseCode" in your result-array.
- Optional access-logging: You can enable access-logging in the module's configuration. After that, every successful request will be logged with it's application-id, apikey-id and token-id.
- Added hooks to all essential functions - that should enable you to customize the module's behavior even more. E.g. you could add custom logging on a hook, if you need that
- Database-scheme does not need foreign-key constraints any more. That should fix @thomasaull 's issue with db-backups. After the update, you must remove the constraint manually because I did not find a way to remove the foreign key safely in all database-environments.
- Multiple other bugfixes

### Changes in 1.0.4 (2020-08-17)

- Usage of `ProcessPageView::pageNotFound`-hook to allow other modules and functions to initialize before the api renders.
- The path to `Routes.php` is now configurable via module's settings
(Thanks to @thomasaull and @spoetnik)

### Changes in 1.0.3 (2020-08-08)

- Bugfix in Router.php (Thanks to @thomasaull)

### Changes in 1.0.2 (2020-07-25)

- Documentation improvements

### Changes in 1.0.1 (2020-07-11)

- Changed all auth-routes to the /auth (or /auth/access) endpoints.
- Updated readme and examples

### Changes in 1.0.0 (2019-08-19)
